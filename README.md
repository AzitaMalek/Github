# Projects
#1: In this project I have 9 different exercise to practice functions, random numbers, distributions and probability calculation. Details of each function is provided in the "Notes" in folder 1.


#2: In this project I have used logistic regression, linear regression, linear discriminant and quadratic discriminant to model the data sets along with some comparisons and conclusions


#3: For two different data sets I have performed the following exercises
-	first two principal components
-	logistic regression
-	n-principal components
-	logistic classifier
-	linear discriminant
-	Under fitting versus Overfitting using cross-validation
-	linear regression model
-	polynomial regression model
-	Lasso

#4: This project is about heart disease prediction. After full analysis and study of the data, I have used decision tree and random forest to predict heart disease based on available data. A full report is provided in the directory.
